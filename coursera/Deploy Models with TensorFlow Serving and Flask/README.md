## Deploy Models with TensorFlow Serving and Flask  

### Overview:  
This is a project-based course on Deploying Models with TensorFlow Serving and Flask. In this project, I have deployed a TensorFlow model with the help of TensorFlow Serving, and created a small web app which will serve as a visual interface to the model inference. TensorFlow Serving is the ideal way to serve TensorFlow models in production, and Flask is a minimal web framework which lets developers create web apps really quickly.  


### Rhyme:  
I used Coursera's hands-on project platform called **Rhyme** to run this project. Using Rhyme, I worked on this project in a hands-on manner in my browser. I got instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops containing all of the software and data I needed for the project. Everything was already set up directly in my Internet browser so I could just focus on learning. For this project, I got instant access to a cloud desktop with (e.g. Python, Jupyter, and Tensorflow) pre-installed.  

### Prerequisites:  
In order to be successful in this project, one should be familiar with Python, TensorFlow, Flask, and HTML.
