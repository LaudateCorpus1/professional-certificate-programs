1. Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to? (2 marks)  

Data Science Methodology: is the routine for finding solutions to a specific problem. It is a cyclic process that undergoes critical behavior guiding data scientists to act accordingly. It includes organizing your work, analyzing different types of data, and solving their problem.  

Topic for Case Study: 'Spam E-mail Detection & Classification':  
The question to be answered: Whether or not the e-mail is a "spam" and classify it accordingly.  

This is one of the first case studies I came across while getting started pursuing Machine Learning as a career. The motive here is to train an e-mail filter using a collection of spam and non-spam (aka “ham”) emails. So, by providing the right answers to train the filter, and later in the prediction phase, its output for a given message would be either “spam” or “ham”. This filter is a classic example of a supervised classification algorithm.  

2. Next, you will play the role of the client and the data scientist.  

Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer. (3 marks)  

You are required to:  
Describe the problem, related to the topic you selected.  
Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data.  

For example, using the food recipes use case discussed in the labs, the question that we defined was, "Can we automatically determine the cuisine of a given dish based on its ingredients?".  

Assuming the roles of both a Data Scientist and a Stakeholder, I have completed the "Business Understanding" phase of the Data Science Methodology by coming up with a 'problem' I'd like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a 'question' that needs to be answered using the data.  

Business Understanding:  

1. The 'Problem':  
This is one of the first case studies I came across while getting started pursuing Machine Learning as a career. The motive here is to train an e-mail filter using a collection of spam and non-spam (aka “ham”) emails. So, by providing the right answers to train the filter, and later in the prediction phase, its output for a given message would be either “spam” or “ham”. This filter is a classic example of a supervised classification algorithm. We get tens or hundreds of e-mails into our inbox every day. They might include the ones from our employers, friends, subscriptions, etc. On the contrary, we also do get loads of fishy e-mail trying to steal our password, give discounts, and ask for personal information to win the lucky draw award.  

2. The 'Question' to be answered based on the problem:  
Whether or not the e-mail is a "spam" and then classify them accordingly as "spam" and "ham" using the appropriate classification technique(s). Here are a few E-mail SPAM trigger words: meet singles, be your own boss, work at home, money back, no credit check, freedom, lose weight, valium, winner, risk-free, etc.
The basic business question to be asked in this phase is: Can we detect such spam mails automatically, and put them in the spam folder?
