# Introduction  

**Stephen Sherman, Sr. Data Scientist at Microsoft**  
- Built a recommendation engine   

**Rafael B. Da Silva**  
- Built NN to predic algae blooms  

**Murtaza Haider, PhD, Ryerson University**  
- Worked on complaints data, Toronto Transit Commission  
- Traits while recruiting: Curiosity, Story-telling (shoul have the potential to empower the listeners, sesnse of awe!), Sense of humor   
- Data Scientists do not talk about their 'false positives' often. Solution: Avoid 'Data Hubris' (the assumption that big data analytics can be used as a substitute rather than a supplement). Ex: overestimation of influenza cases by Google Flu Trends  
Image Recognition using [IBM Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/studio/watson-vision-combined/default/view?service_guid=crn:v1:bluemix:public:watson-vision-combined:us-south:a/daf2a84f216a4987b25a68802c9a66c4:e15ac5dc-26e0-489a-b6d5-e7f390599692::&project_id=7a3374e2-1c5d-4ff5-9acc-91d54e68a37d)  

**Norman White, NYU Stern**  
- History of Big Data: Larry Page and Sergey Brin trying to figure out page rank algorithm. But, there was no technology to store all the web pages in the world  
- Mapper and Reduce processes by Google  
- Decision Sciences emerged  
- DL, NN have found their practical applications today: Multi-layer NN by UofT used by Google Facebook, etc.  
- DL: is just NN on steroids, more hidden layers with more computing power added  
- Learn by building: Built his first HPC Cluster (Beowulf cluster)  
- Today, we can 'simulate' before 'building' something. Manufacturing is becoming more digital: GE had a platform to build, design jet engines. Now, GE is selling it to other manufacturing companies  
- Applications of ML: Recommender Systems, Classification, Cluster Analysis, Market Basket Analysis, Self Precitive Analytics,...  
- Book by Foster Provost  
- IoT, Zigbee Networks  

**John Rollins**, Data Scientist, IBM Analytics, IBM  
- Wrote the 'The Data Science Methodology' course for this specialization
