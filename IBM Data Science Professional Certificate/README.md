- History of Big Data: Larry Page and Sergey Brin trying to figure out page rank algorithm. But, there was no technology to store all the web pages in the world  
- Mapper and Reduce processes by Google  
- Decision Sciences emerged  
- DL, NN have found their practical applications today: Multi-layer NN by UofT used by Google Facebook, etc.  
- DL: is just NN on steroids, more hidden layers with more computing power added  
- Learn by building: Built his first HPC Cluster (Beowulf cluster)  
- Today, we can 'simulate' before 'building' something. Manufacturing is becoming more digital: GE had a platform to build, design jet engines. Now, GE is selling it to other manufacturing companies  
- Applications of ML: Recommender Systems, Classification, Cluster Analysis, Market Basket Analysis, Self Precitive Analytics,...  
- Book by Foster Provost  
- IoT, Zigbee Networks
